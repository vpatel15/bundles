# Contributing

This small document explains how to contribute to this project.

## Boards

A kanban board is available to track tasks to do, ready to do, in progress or
done. Please, check https://waffle.io/liip/TheA11yMachine/.

## Tools

To hack this project, only [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and
[NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are required. The latter comes with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a dependency manager. A browser may also be
required, but this is not necessary.

## Set up your environment

First, you need to clone the Git repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:liip/TheA11yMachine.git
$ cd TheA11yMachine
```

From here, you must install the dependencies with NPM:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now you're ready to develop.
Please, commits your patches on another branch than `master`. This is easier for
you to receive updates. For instance:

```sh
$ git checkout -b my_new_feature
```

## Running tests

Unfortunately we have no test suites yet. This is a nice contribution!
